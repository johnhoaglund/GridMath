# GridMath
GridMath is a series of routines that performs desired mathematical operations on one or multiple grids.  The program defines its operational domain by reading a Surfer 6 file header.
ver 1.0 was compiled using Absoft Fortran 1.0
ver 1.1 was compiled using Absoft Fortran 15.0, converting the comments and continuation characters to be fully F90 compliant.
A new version is in progress to include (X,Y,Z) and/or (Col, Row, Z) reading to read Z values into a grid.
